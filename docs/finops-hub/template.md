This template creates a new **FinOps hub** instance.

FinOps hubs include:

- Data Lake storage to host cost data.
- Data Factory for data processing and orchestration.
- Key Vault for storing secrets.

<blockquote class="important" markdown="1">
  _To use this template, you will need to create a Cost Management export that publishes cost data to the `msexports` container in the included storage account. See [Create a new hub](README.md#-create-a-new-hub) for details._
</blockquote>

<br>

## üìã Prerequisites

Please ensure the following prerequisites are met before deploying this template:

1. You must have permission to create the [deployed resources](#Ô∏è-resources).
2. The Microsoft.EventGrid resource provider must be registered in your subscription. See [Register a resource provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider) for details.

   <blockquote class="important" markdown="1">
     _If you forget this step, the deployment will succeed, but the pipeline trigger will not be started and data will not be ready. See [Troubleshooting Power BI reports](reports/README.md#-troubleshooting-power-bi-reports) for details._

## üì• Parameters

| Parameter        | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                       | Default value             |
| ---------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **hubName**      | String | Optional. Name of the hub. Used to ensure unique resource names.                                                                                                                  | `"finops-hub"`            |
| **location**     | String | Optional. Azure location where all resources should be created. See https://aka.ms/azureregions.                                                                                  | (resource group location) |
| **storageSku**   | String | Optional. Storage SKU to use. LRS = Lowest cost, ZRS = High availability. Note Standard SKUs are not available for Data Lake gen2 storage. Allowed: `Premium_LRS`, `Premium_ZRS`. | `Premium_LRS`             |
| **tags**         | Object | Optional. Tags to apply to all resources. We will also add the `cm-resource-parent` tag for improved cost roll-ups in Cost Management.                                            |
| **exportScopes** | Array  | Optional. List of scope IDs to create exports for.                                                                                                                                |

## üéõÔ∏è Resources

The following resources are created in the target resource group during deployment.

Resources use the following naming convention: `<hubName>-<purpose>-<unique-suffix>`. Names are adjusted to account for length and character restrictions. The `<unique-suffix>` is used to ensure resource names are globally unique where required.

- `<hubName>store<unique-suffix>` storage account (Data Lake Storage Gen2)
  - Blob containers:
    - `msexports` ‚Äì Temporarily stores Cost Management exports.
    - `ingestion` ‚Äì Stores ingested data.
      > ‚ÑπÔ∏è _In the future, we will use this container to stage external data outside of Cost Management._
    - `config` ‚Äì Stores hub metadata and configuration settings. Files:
      - `settings.json` ‚Äì Hub settings.
- `<hubName>-engine-<unique-suffix>` Data Factory instance
  - Pipelines:
    - `msexport_extract` ‚Äì Triggers the ingestion process for Cost Management exports to account for Data Factory pipeline trigger limits.
    - `msexports_transform` ‚Äì Converts Cost Management exports into parquet or gzipped CSV and removes historical data duplicated in each day's export.
  - Triggers:
    - `msexport` ‚Äì Triggers the `msexport_extract` pipeline when Cost Management exports complete.
- `<hubName>-vault-<unique-suffix>` Key Vault instance
  - Secrets:
    - Data Factory system managed identity

In addition to the above, the following resources are created to automate the deployment process. Each of these can be safely removed after deployment without impacting runtime functionality. Note they will be recreated if you redeploy the template.

- Managed identities:
  - `<storage>_config_blobManager` ([Storage Blob Data Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-contributor)) ‚Äì Uploads the settings.json file.
  - `<datafactory>_msexports_extract_triggerManager` ([Data Factory Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#data-factory-contributor)) ‚Äì Stops triggers before deployment and starts them after deployment.
- Deployment scripts (automatically deleted after a successful deployment):
  - `<datafactory>_stopHubTriggers` ‚Äì Stops all triggers in the hub using the triggerManager identity.
  - `<datafactory>_startHubTriggers` ‚Äì Starts all triggers in the hub using the triggerManager identity.
  - `uploadSettings` ‚Äì Uploads the settings.json file using the blobManager identity.
