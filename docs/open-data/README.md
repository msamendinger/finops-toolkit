Reporting is the life-blood of any FinOps initiative. And your reports are only as good as your data. This is why [data ingestion and normalization](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/finops/capabilities-ingestion-normalization) is such an important part of FinOps (and any big data effort). The following datasets can be used to clean and normalize your data as part of data ingestion, reporting, or other solutions.

## üó∫Ô∏è Regions

Microsoft Cost Management provides various values for resource locations that are occasionally inconsistent due to different underlying systems providing the data. The Regions file provides a list of values you may find within common cost-related datasets (e.g., Cost Management exports and price sheets) along with their related Azure region IDs and names.

Sample data:

| OriginalValue | RegionId      | RegionName     |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| AP East       | eastasia      | East Asia      |
| CA Central    | canadacentral | Canada Central |
| DE North      | germanynorth  | Germany North  |
| NO West       | norwaywest    | Norway West    |
| TW North      | taiwannorth   | Taiwan North   |
