<blockquote class="warning" markdown="1">
    _FOCUS commands were implemented before Microsoft Cost Management supported a native FOCUS export. Going forward, we recommend using the native export. These commands will remain available but will not be updated to support FOCUS 1.0-preview. If you have a scenario where you need a PowerShell converter, please leave feedback at [aka.ms/ftk](https://aka.ms/ftk)._

The FOCUS PowerShell commands help you work with the [FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification (FOCUS)](../../focus/README.md).
