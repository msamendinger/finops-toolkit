It includes the standard metrics aligned with the Cloud Adoption Framework for all disciplines and has the capability to identify and apply recommendations to address non-compliant resources.

## âž• Deploy the workbook

1. Confirm you have the following least-privileged roles to deploy and use the workbook:

   - **Workbook Contributor** allows you to deploy and make changes to the workbook.
   - **Cost Management Reader** allows you to view the costs in the Cost Management tab only.
   - **Reader** allows you to view all tabs.

   <blockquote class="tip" markdown="1">
     _If you only have read access, you can still import your workbook directly into Azure Monitor. You will not be able to save it, but you can view all tabs._
   </blockquote>

2. [Deploy the **governance-workbook** template](../resources/deploy.md).
