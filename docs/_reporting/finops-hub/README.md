FinOps hubs are a reliable, trustworthy platform for cost analytics, insights, and optimization ‚Äì virtual command centers for leaders throughout the organization to report on, monitor, and optimize cost based on their organizational needs. FinOps hubs focus on 3 core design principles:

- **Be the standard**<br>_<sup>Strive to be the principal embodiment of the FinOps Framework.</sup>_
- **Built for scale**<br>_<sup>Designed to support the largest accounts and organizations.</sup>_
- **Open and extensible**<br>_<sup>Embrace the ecosystem and prioritize enabling the platform.</sup>_

We are very early in our journey. Today, FinOps hubs extend Cost Management by exporting cost details to a consolidated storage account and addressing a few of the inherent limitations that make exports more difficult to use. In their most basic form, FinOps hubs enable more Power BI reporting options. On the more advanced end, FinOps hubs are a foundation for you to build your own cost management and optimization solution.

<blockquote class="highlight-green-title" markdown="1">
  üíµ Estimated cost: $25 per $1M in cost

Exact cost of the solution may vary. Cost is primarily for data storage and number of times data is ingested. Pipelines will run once a day per export.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Why FinOps hubs?

Many organizations that use Microsoft Cost Management eventually hit a wall where they need some capability that isn't natively available. When they do, their only options are to leverage one of the many third party tools or build something from scratch. While the cost management tooling ecosystem is rich and vast with many great options, they may be overkill or perhaps they don't solve specific needs. In these cases, organizations export cost data and build a custom solution. But this comes with many challenges, as these organizations are not generally staffed with the data engineers needed to design, build, and maintain a scalable data platform. FinOps hubs seeks to provide that foundation to streamline efforts in getting up and running with your own homegrown cost management solution.

FinOps hubs will streamline implementing the FinOps Framework, are being designed to scale to meet the largest enterprise needs, and will be open and extensible to support building custom solutions without the hassle of building the backend data store. FinOps hubs are designed for and by the community. Please join the discussion and let us know what you'd like to see next or learn how to contribute and be a part of the team.

## ‚ûï Create a new hub

1. Register the Microsoft.EventGrid and Microsoft.CostManagementExports resource providers. See [Register a resource provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider) for details.
2. [Deploy the **finops-hub** template](../resources/deploy.md).

   [![Deploy To Azure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/deploytoazure.svg?sanitize=true)](https://aka.ms/finops/hubs/deploy) &nbsp; [![Deploy To Azure US Gov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/deploytoazuregov.svg?sanitize=true)](https://aka.ms/finops/hubs/deploy/gov) &nbsp; [![Deploy To Azure China](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/deploytoazurechina.svg?sanitize=true)](https://aka.ms/finops/hubs/deploy/china)

3. [Create a new FOCUS cost export](https://aka.ms/exportsv2) using the following settings:

   <!-- TODO: Replace the portal link with the docs link when exports v2 docs are available.
   1. [Create a new FOCUS cost export](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/tutorial-export-acm-data?tabs=azure-portal) using the following settings:
   -->

   - **Type of data** = `Cost and usage details (FOCUS)`
     <blockquote class="important" markdown="1">
       _FinOps hubs 0.2 requires FOCUS cost data. While FOCUS is fully supported, the option to export FOCUS cost data from Cost Management is currently in preview and has not rolled out to everyone yet. In order to create and manage FOCUS exports, please use the [Exports preview link](https://aka.ms/exportsv2)._
     </blockquote>
   - **Dataset version** = `1.0-preview (v1)`
   - **Frequency** = `Daily export of month-to-date costs`
     <blockquote class="tip" markdown="1">
       _Configuring a daily export starts in the current month. If you want to backfill historical data, create a one-time export and set the start/end dates to the desired date range._
     </blockquote>
   - **File partitioning** = On
   - **Storage account** = (Use subscription/resource from step 1)
   - **Container** = `msexports`
   - **Directory** = (Use the resource ID of the scope<sup>1</sup> you're exporting without the first "/")

4. Run your export.
   - Exports can take up to a day to show up after first created.
   - Use the **Run now** command at the top of the Cost Management Exports page.
   - Your data should be available within 15 minutes or so, depending on how big your account is.
5. Download one or more of the available Power BI starter templates from the [latest release](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/releases):
   - [Cost summary](../power-bi/cost-summary.md) for standard cost roll-ups.
   - [Commitment discounts](../power-bi/commitment-discounts.md) for commitment-based savings utilization and coverage.
6. [Connect Power BI to your hub](../power-bi/README.md#-connect-to-your-data)

If you run into any issues, see [Troubleshooting Power BI reports](../resources/troubleshooting.md).

_<sup>1) A "scope" is an Azure construct that contains resources or enables purchasing services, like a resource group, subscription, management group, or billing account. The resource ID for a scope will be the Azure Resource Manager URI that identifies the scope (e.g., "/subscriptions/###" for a subscription or "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/###" for a billing account). To learn more, see [Understand and work with scopes](https://aka.ms/costmgmt/scopes).</sup>_

## üõ´ Get started with hubs

After deploying a hub instance, there are several ways for you to get started:

1. Customize the built-in Power BI reports.

   Our Power BI reports are starter templates and intended to be customized. We encourage you to customize as needed. [Learn more](../power-bi/README.md).

2. Create your own Power BI reports.

   If you'd like to create your own reports or add cost data to an existing report, you can either [copy queries from a pre-built report](../power-bi/README.md#setup-a-finops-hub-report) or [connect manually](../power-bi/README.md#connect-manually) using the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 connector.

3. Connect to Microsoft Fabric for advanced queries.

   If you use OneLake in Microsoft Fabric, you can create a shortcut to the `ingestion` container in your hubs storage account to run SQL or KQL queries directly against the data in hubs. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-analytics/onelake-shortcuts?tabs=adlsgen2).

4. Access the cost data from custom tools.

   Cost data is stored in an [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction) account. You can use any tool that supports Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 to access the data. Refer to the [data dictionary](./data-dictionary.md) for details about available columns.

5. Apply cost allocation logic, augment, or manipulate your cost data using Data Factory.

   [Data Factory](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/introduction) is used to ingest and transform data. We recommend using Data Factory as a cost-efficient solution to apply custom logic to your cost data. Do not modify built-in pipelines or data in the **msexports** container. If you create custom pipelines, monitor new data in the **ingestion** container and use a consistent prefix to ensure they don't overlap with new pipelines. Refer to [data processing](./data-processing.md) for details about how data is processed.

   <blockquote class="important" markdown="1">
     _Keep in mind this is the primary area we are planning to evolve in [upcoming FinOps toolkit releases](https://aka.ms/finops/toolkit/roadmap). Please familiarize yourself with our roadmap to avoid conflicts with future updates. Consider [contributing to the project](../CONTRIBUTING.md) to add support for new scenarios to avoid conflicts._
   </blockquote>

6. Generate custom alerts using Power Automate.

   You have many options for generating custom alerts. [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/connectors/details/shared_azureblob/azure-blob-storage) is a great option for people who are new to automation but you can also use [Data Factory](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/introduction), [Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview), or any other service that supports custom code or direct access to data in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

No matter what you choose to do, we recommend creating a new Bicep module to support updating your solution. You can reference `finops-hub/main.bicep` or `hub.bicep` directly to ensure you can apply new updates as they're released.

If you need to change `hub.bicep`, be sure to track those changes and re-apply them when upgrading to the latest release. We generally don't recommend modifying the template or modules directly to avoid conflicts with future updates. Instead, consider contributing those changes back to the open source project. [Learn more](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you access data in storage or are creating or customizing Power BI reports, please refer to the [data dictionary](data-dictionary.md) for details about the available columns.
