The FinOps toolkit is a collection of customizable ARM templates used to build and deploy various FinOps solutions that automate and extend native Microsoft Cost Management capabilities. The toolkit aims to include:

- Starter kits that help you get started with Cost Management.
- Automation scripts to streamline cost configuration and management at scale.
- Advanced solutions to facilitate building custom solutions.

While you will find numerous ARM templates within this repository, our main focus is to build a reliable, trustworthy platform for cost analytics, insights, and optimization, which we call **FinOps hubs**.

FinOps hubs are **virtual command centers** for leaders throughout the organization to report on, monitor, and optimize cost based on their organizational needs. FinOps hubs focus on 3 core design principles:

- **Be the standard**<br>_<sup>Strive to be the principal embodiment of the FinOps Framework.</sup>_
- **Built for scale**<br>_<sup>Designed to support the largest accounts and organizations.</sup>_
- **Open and extensible**<br>_<sup>Embrace the ecosystem and prioritize enabling the platform.</sup>_
